  Phase 7 of docs/legacy-pages-plan.md — /website-designs, the last legacy page.
  Copy follows the SEO page brief (Sep 2026: focus "web design company",
  secondary "company website design"). The gallery names and alt text are still
  verbatim from the live page, including "ecommerce Designs" in lower case.

  ◈ Live-site defect: the page's "CASE STUDIES" band is unfinished — five
  identical cards reading "Hospitality / It is a long established fact that a
  reader will be distracted by the readable content. / WEBSITE WEBSITE". That is
  lorem ipsum, not content, so it is NOT reproduced. The rebuild puts the real
  website case studies from case-studies.ts in that slot instead.
