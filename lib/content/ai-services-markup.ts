    q: "Which AI models and platforms do you use?",

        <p>AI earns its place in a business when it takes over a specific job that happens again and again: answering the same questions, typing the same details into two systems, writing the first draft of the same email.</p>
        <p>We start with those jobs, not with the technology. We find where your team loses hours each week, pick the work AI handles well and build the tool that fits. Some businesses need a single chatbot. Others need a plan, two integrations and a voice agent.</p>
        <p class="text-band-ink">Whichever it is, one UK team builds it, tests it and keeps it working.</p>
