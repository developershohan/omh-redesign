      { q: "What does an Instagram marketing agency actually do?", a: "An Instagram marketing agency handles everything your business needs on the platform: content strategy, Reels and carousel creation, paid Instagram ads, community management, analytics and reporting. At OMH, we assign a dedicated Instagram strategist to your account who builds a tailored plan, creates on-brand content, manages your ad campaigns and reports on results every month." },
      { q: "How long does it take to see results from Instagram marketing?", a: "With paid Instagram ads, you can expect to see initial traffic and engagement within the first week. Meaningful conversion data typically builds over 4 to 6 weeks as we test audiences and creative. For organic Instagram growth, expect steady follower and engagement increases from month two onwards, with compounding results over 3 to 6 months." },
      { q: "How many Instagram posts do you publish per week?", a: "This depends on your package. Most clients receive between 3 and 5 feed posts per week, plus daily Stories. Reels are typically produced 2 to 4 times per month. Your account manager will recommend a cadence based on your audience size, goals and budget." },
      { q: "What kind of Instagram content do you create?", a: "We create Reels (short-form video), carousel posts (multi-image swipe posts), single-image feed posts, Stories and Story Highlights. Every piece is designed for Instagram natively, with proper dimensions, on-brand visuals and copy that includes a clear call to action and relevant hashtags. We send everything for your approval before publishing." },
      { q: "Can I review Instagram content before it goes live?", a: "Yes. We send all content for your review and approval before scheduling. You will see the visual, caption, hashtags and posting time. Once approved, we schedule and publish everything. If you need changes, we include one round of revisions on all creative." },
      { q: "How do you measure Instagram marketing success?", a: "We track the metrics that matter for your goals: reach, engagement rate, follower growth, Story completion rate, Reel plays, website clicks, leads and sales. You receive a monthly report with a plain-English summary of what worked, what underperformed and what we are adjusting. We also schedule a monthly call to walk through the numbers together." },
      { q: "Do you manage paid Instagram ads as well as organic content?", a: "Yes. We are an Instagram ads agency as well as a content and management agency. We build, launch and optimise paid campaigns across Instagram Stories, Reels, Explore and feed placements. We handle audience targeting, budget pacing, creative testing and reporting. Organic content and paid ads work together in our strategy." },

We offer transparent monthly pricing with no hidden fees. Get in touch for a custom quote based on your goals." },
      { q: "Why should I hire an Instagram marketing agency instead of doing it in-house?", a: "Running Instagram well takes consistent content production, creative design, community management, ad management and analytics. Most small business owners do not have the time or the specialist tools to do all of that alongside running their business. An Instagram marketing company like OMH gives you a dedicated team that handles the full workload, stays on top of algorithm changes and applies what works across our other client accounts to yours." },

    title: "Facebook Marketing Agency FAQs",
    subtitle: "Common questions about working with a Facebook marketing agency.",
    items: [
      { q: "What Facebook marketing services do you offer?", a: "We provide a complete range of Facebook marketing services for UK businesses: Facebook Business Page setup and optimisation, content creation and scheduling (posts, Stories, Reels), Facebook Ads campaign management, audience building with Custom and Lookalike Audiences, community management and Messenger responses, Facebook Shop setup, and monthly performance reporting. Each service can be booked individually or as part of a managed Facebook marketing package." },
      { q: "How long will it take to see results from Facebook marketing?", a: "Organic Facebook marketing typically shows measurable engagement improvements within four to eight weeks. Building a consistent following and driving regular traffic to your website usually takes three to six months. Facebook Ads campaigns can generate clicks, leads and enquiries within days of launching, with optimisation improving results over the first two to four weeks. We set benchmarks at the start of every engagement and track progress against them monthly." },
      { q: "How much does a Facebook marketing agency charge?", a: "Our Facebook marketing packages start at an affordable entry-level price for small businesses. Pricing depends on the scope of work: organic-only packages (content creation, scheduling, community management) cost less than packages that include Facebook Ads management. Your account manager will recommend the right package based on your goals, budget and the number of services you need. Contact us for a detailed breakdown." },
      { q: "What kind of content do you create for Facebook?", a: "We create a mix of content types tailored to your audience and goals: branded graphic posts, short-form video (Reels), photo carousels, Facebook Stories, text updates, polls and event promotions. Every post includes a clear call to action and is designed for the Facebook algorithm, which prioritises content that generates comments and shares. Before anything goes live, we send it for your review and approval." },
      { q: "Can I review Facebook content before you post it?", a: "Yes. We send all Facebook content for your approval before scheduling. You see the post copy, images or video, hashtags and the proposed posting time. Once you approve, we schedule using Meta Business Suite and confirm it is live. If you want changes, we revise and resubmit." },
      { q: "Will you provide Facebook marketing reports?", a: "Yes. Every Facebook marketing package includes a monthly report covering page followers, post reach and engagement, website clicks from Facebook, ad spend and ROAS (if running Facebook Ads), and community management activity. The report is built around the goals you set at the start, so you can see clearly whether your Facebook marketing is delivering." },
      { q: "Do you manage Facebook Ads as well as organic content?", a: "Yes. Our Facebook marketing agency handles both organic Facebook content and paid Facebook Ads campaigns. Many of our clients start with organic content management and add Facebook Ads once their page is established and generating engagement. We can run both from the start if your goals require faster results. The organic content and paid campaigns are managed together to make sure messaging is consistent and the two approaches support each other." },
      { q: "What Facebook advertising formats do you support?", a: "We create and manage Facebook Ads across all available formats: single image ads, video ads, carousel ads, collection ads, lead generation forms and Messenger ads. We also set up remarketing campaigns using the Facebook Pixel to reach people who have already visited your website. The right format depends on your campaign objective. Your Facebook marketing expert will recommend the best combination for your budget and goals." },
      { q: "How do you build a Facebook audience for my business?", a: "We start by reviewing your existing Facebook audience and customer data. From there, we build Custom Audiences from your customer lists, website visitors (via the Facebook Pixel) and people who have engaged with your Facebook page or ads. We then create Lookalike Audiences to find new potential customers who match your existing buyers. Organic content is designed to encourage shares and comments, which extends your reach beyond the people who already follow your page." },
      { q: "Can I request additional Facebook posts or services?", a: "Yes. We can adjust your package at any time. If you need more posts, additional Facebook Ads campaigns, a Facebook Group setup, or expanded community management, your account manager will prepare a custom proposal. Many of our Facebook marketing clients start with a standard package and scale up as they see results." },
      { q: "How do I choose the best Facebook marketing agency?", a: "Look for an agency that manages both organic content and Facebook Ads, provides transparent monthly reporting tied to your goals, and has experience with businesses similar to yours. Ask about their pricing structure, minimum contract length, and whether you will have a dedicated account manager. A good Facebook marketing company will show you case studies or results from previous clients and be upfront about what is realistic for your budget." },
      { q: "Is Facebook marketing worth it for small businesses?", a: "Yes. Facebook remains the largest social media platform, with 44 million UK users. For small businesses, Facebook marketing offers a low entry cost, precise audience targeting and the ability to reach local customers through location-based ads and community pages. Our Facebook marketing agency for small business clients typically sees measurable results within the first three months of a structured campaign. The key is having a clear strategy and consistent execution, which is what our packages are designed to provide." },
      { q: "What is the difference between a Facebook marketing agency and managing Facebook yourself?", a: "A Facebook marketing agency brings three things that are hard to replicate in-house: platform expertise, creative capacity and time. Our Facebook marketing experts stay current with algorithm changes, ad policy updates and new features. We produce professional content consistently, without the stop-start pattern that happens when Facebook is managed alongside other business tasks. And we handle the daily monitoring, replies and reporting that keep a Facebook presence active. For most small and medium businesses, the cost of an agency is lower than hiring a dedicated in-house social media manager." },
